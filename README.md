# Yolov8
Detection of License plate and recognition of characters on them is performed.Yolov8 is used for detection of License plate which increases accuracy  and speed in the detection compared to the previous versions of yolo. A dataset consisting of images of License plate is collected and then this dataset is divided into two sets of train and valid. This dataset consists of images of license plates in different angles and different sizes which helps in the efficient training of the model. After this we train the YOLOv8 model using this dataset. After training the model is able to detect the license plate and then this detected license plate is then pre-processed to give the best quality image for the recognition of characters present on the Detected License plate. License plate consists of multiple languages and numerics. These characters can be in different fonts and sizes, hence LPRnet is used which is specifically designed for License Plate character recognition.
